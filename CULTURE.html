                    <p><b>What?</b>
                      On August 15, 2024, I participated in the Freshie Walk event organized by Silliman University. This event is a special tradition for first-year students to officially kick off their journey at the university. As we arrived, the council asked for volunteers, and without knowing exactly what we were volunteering for, my friends and I eagerly raised our hands. To our surprise, we were tasked with handling the drums for the college chant! This was a first for us, and we had no prior experience with drums, so the situation was both exciting and nerve-wracking. </p>                   <br>
                    <p><b>So What?</b>
                      Although we had no prior knowledge of drumming, the experience turned out to be much more fun than we expected. The energy of the Freshie Walk combined with our spontaneous drumming session created a unique and electrifying atmosphere. We felt part of something bigger, and the shared sense of excitement among us and our fellow students made the event memorable. This experience taught me how stepping out of my comfort zone can lead to unexpected yet rewarding moments, and how sometimes the most memorable experiences come from being thrown into new, challenging situations.</p>

                      <br>
                    <p><b>Now What?</b>
                      After this experience, I’m more open to embracing new opportunities, even if they seem unfamiliar or intimidating at first. I plan to take on more challenges throughout my college journey and look for ways to contribute, whether it’s participating in more activities or taking on leadership roles. I also realize the importance of teamwork, as our ability to work together in the moment played a huge role in making the event enjoyable.</p>

                      <br>
                    <p><b>Because of this activity, I am...</b>
                      more confident in taking on new experiences and less afraid to try something I’ve never done before. The Freshie Walk not only helped me bond with my classmates but also instilled a sense of pride and excitement in being a part of the Silliman University community.</p>

                        <p><b>What?</b>
                          On August 26, 2024, I participated in the Parada Sillimaniana, a significant event that celebrates Silliman University’s founding anniversary. We were initially assigned logistics roles, thinking our job would involve just assisting behind the scenes and organizing things. However, once again, the council called for volunteers, and without much hesitation, my friends and I eagerly raised our hands. Much to our surprise, we were selected to be the drummers for the parade, just like we were at the Freshie Walk! It was unexpected, and we couldn’t help but laugh at the irony, but it turned out to be another amazing experience.       </p>

                          <br>
                        <p><b>So What?</b>
                          This second time around, the spontaneity of it all made the experience even more exciting and memorable. We had no prior knowledge of drumming, but that didn’t stop us from having fun and embracing the challenge. The atmosphere of the parade, combined with the energy of the crowd and our collective enthusiasm, made the event so special. This experience really highlighted the beauty of spontaneous opportunities, showing me how unexpected moments can sometimes lead to the best memories.       </p>

                          <br>
                        <p><b>Now What?</b>
                          After this event, I’ve learned to always be open to the unexpected, even if it’s outside of my comfort zone. I’ve realized that it’s often these unplanned moments that create the most meaningful experiences. In the future, I’m going to be more willing to step up when opportunities arise, because you never know where they might lead. This experience also strengthened my bond with my classmates, and I look forward to more adventures where we can make lasting memories together.       </p>

The Parada Sillimaniana reminded me that sometimes the best moments are the ones you never expect.       </p>

                      <p><b>What?</b>  
                        On Setyembre 13, 2024, I had the opportunity to attend Kuwerdas Filipinas Symphonic Rondalla, a live performance led by the renowned Dr. Ramón P. Santos, National Artist for Music. As someone new to live music shows, this experience was eye-opening and truly inspiring. The performance featured a symphonic rondalla, a unique and captivating blend of traditional Filipino instruments. What made this event stand out was not only the beautiful arrangements but also the creativity of the performers, who incorporated body movements like tapping instruments and stomping their feet to enhance the rhythm.  </p>

                        <br>
                      <p><b>So What?</b>
                        The second piece of the performance, in particular, was my favorite. The dynamic use of instruments and the performers’ physicality added an unexpected energy that made the performance more immersive. The creativity of combining the traditional sounds with contemporary pop in the final performance was a highlight, especially the rendition of BINI's "Pantropiko." It was an exciting and engaging mix of modern and traditional, which energized the audience and gave a fresh twist to Filipino music. Stephany’s soprano performance was another standout moment, adding depth and elegance to the show.  </p>

                        <br>
                      <p><b>Now What?</b>
                        Attending this event has deepened my appreciation for Filipino music and its ability to evolve and fuse with contemporary elements while staying rooted in tradition. I’m inspired by the creativity and passion that went into the performance and have realized how music can transcend genres and engage audiences in unexpected ways. Going forward, I want to explore more live performances to continue expanding my understanding and appreciation for different musical styles and cultural expressions.  </p>

                      The Acquaintance Party for the College of Computer Studies was an event filled with fun, laughter, and bonding among students and faculty. As the Food Committee Head, I was responsible for ensuring that everyone was well-fed and satisfied throughout the event. Since this was my first time taking on such a role, it came with its fair share of challenges. Managing everything, especially with a large crowd, was definitely not easy. From coordinating with the caterers to ensuring that the food was served on time and in good condition, it required a lot of focus and effort.</p>

                    
                      <p><b>So What?</b>
                        Despite the initial difficulties, the experience taught me valuable lessons in time management, organization, and teamwork. I learned the importance of staying calm under pressure and trusting my team to handle tasks efficiently. Seeing everyone enjoy the food and the event made all the effort worthwhile. The experience was not only fulfilling but also a great opportunity for personal growth and skill development.</p>

I also plan to refine my organizational skills and develop better strategies for handling large-scale responsibilities. Moving forward, I’ll be better prepared to tackle challenges and ensure smoother execution of tasks.</p>

                  <p><b>What?</b> 
                    On October 5-6, 2024, at 7:00 PM, I attended Rama, Hari at the Claire Isabel McGill Luce Auditorium, organized by the Silliman University Culture and Arts Council. The performance blended dance, music, and drama, telling the epic story of Rama Hari through the works of five National Artists: Alice Reyes (choreography), Ryan Cayabyab (music), Bienvenido Lumbera (libretto), Salvador Bernal (production design), and Rolando Tinio (English translations). As a participant, my role was to watch and experience the performance, appreciating the collaboration of these artists to bring the story to life.  </p>



                    <p><b>So What?</b>
                      I learned to appreciate ballet as an art form that tells a story through movement, music, and design. Initially, I expected a traditional ballet, but the use of shadow play during the final fight scene surprised me and added a new dimension to the performance. The creativity in blending different artistic elements left a strong impression on me. The most satisfying part was witnessing the choreography and the visual elements come together to convey a complex story. This experience reaffirmed my appreciation for the arts and how they can express deep, universal themes.  </p>




                      <p><b>Now What?</b>
                        This experience has expanded my understanding of the performing arts, particularly ballet, as a powerful tool for storytelling. I can apply this new perspective by supporting and attending more performances, as well as seeking out diverse forms of art that communicate ideas and emotions in unique ways. I see the value of the arts in promoting culture and bringing people together, and I plan to continue exploring this interest by engaging with future performances and events.  </p>

                <p><b>What?</b> 
                  On November 27, 2024, I participated in the Tree Lighting Ceremony held at Silliman University. The event took place in the evening and marked the beginning of the holiday season, bringing together the university community in a festive atmosphere. The objective of the ceremony was to celebrate the start of the Christmas season with a symbolic lighting of the Christmas tree, a tradition that unites students, faculty, and staff. As a participant, my role was to witness the ceremony and partake in the celebration of joy and togetherness.</p>



                  <br>
                <p><b>So What?</b>
                  I learned the importance of community and tradition in building school spirit and connecting individuals to shared cultural experiences. My initial expectation was simply to enjoy the festivities, but I was pleasantly surprised by the sense of unity and warmth among everyone present. The atmosphere was filled with excitement, and I was touched by the genuine enthusiasm of the participants. The most satisfying part of the event was seeing the tree light up, symbolizing hope and the start of a new season. This experience reminded me of the value of coming together to celebrate important moments in life. It reinforced my belief in the power of tradition to bring people together, especially during the holiday season.</p>

                <p><b>Now What?</b>
                  This experience has deepened my appreciation for the role of community events in fostering a sense of belonging and joy. I can apply this learning by engaging more in such activities and helping to create similar experiences for others. I see the benefit of these gatherings in strengthening bonds and creating lasting memories. If I could do the event again, I would try to become more involved in the planning or organizing aspect to contribute to making it even more special for everyone.</p>

              <p><b>What?</b> 
                On November 28, 2024, I participated in the Entrep Fair at Silliman University Senior High School (SHS). The event took place during the day and was a showcase of entrepreneurial projects and ideas from the students. The objective of the fair was to promote creativity, business skills, and the entrepreneurial spirit within the SHS community. As a participant, my role was to observe the various booths, interact with the exhibitors, and learn about the innovative projects presented by my peers.</p>


                <br>
               <p><b>So What?</b>
                I learned about the practical application of business concepts and how students transform their ideas into real-world entrepreneurial projects. My initial expectation was to simply look at the different business ideas, but I was surprised by the ingenuity and creativity of the products and services being offered. I was especially impressed by the passion and dedication of the students who put their projects together. The most satisfying part of the fair was seeing how ideas, teamwork, and hard work could lead to successful ventures. This experience highlighted the importance of innovation and collaboration in business. It also reinforced my belief in the value of hands-on learning and entrepreneurship as key drivers of personal and community growth.</p>


                <br>
              <p><b>Now What?</b>
                This experience has inspired me to think more critically about business ideas and how I can apply creativity in my own projects. I can continue my involvement by exploring entrepreneurial opportunities and considering how I might turn an idea into a project or business. I see the benefits of participating in such fairs as they foster a sense of innovation, teamwork, and critical thinking. If I could be involved again, I would be interested in contributing to a team project or even organizing a booth to gain more insight into the entrepreneurial process.</p>
