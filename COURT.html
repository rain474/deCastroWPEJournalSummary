                    <p><b>What?</b>
                    On August 22, 2024, I participated in the Esports Leaderboards: Eliminations organized by the College of Computer Studies. This event was an intense yet exciting competition where participants showcased their skills in various online games. The eliminations stage was particularly competitive as everyone was determined to secure their spot on the leaderboard.    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>So What?</b>
                    Participating in this event was a thrilling experience that combined teamwork, strategy, and quick decision-making. It was more than just a gaming competition—it was an opportunity to connect with fellow students who shared the same passion for esports. The eliminations helped me develop not only my technical gaming skills but also my ability to stay composed under pressure. The camaraderie and sportsmanship displayed by the participants made the experience even more rewarding.    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Now What?</b>
                    This event has deepened my interest in esports and inspired me to further hone my gaming skills(hehe) while maintaining a balance between leisure and academics. I also hope to participate in more esports events in the future, not just as a player but possibly as part of the organizing team to contribute to the growth of esports within our college.    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Because of this activity, I am...</b>

                        On October 8, 2024, I attended the basketball game between Barangay Motong and Barangay Taclobo as part of the Kagawad Jason Lagahit Cup tournament. The match was thrilling, with players from both teams showcasing their skills and teamwork. It was an exciting evening of friendly competition and camaraderie in our community.    </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>So What?</b>
                        A funny and unexpected moment of the night was realizing that some of my barangay friends were playing in the game! None of us had mentioned it to each other beforehand, so we all found it hilarious to meet there and share surprised smiles. It was a great reminder of how small and interconnected our community is, adding a layer of enjoyment to the event. Watching them play gave me a newfound appreciation for their athletic talent and dedication to representing our barangay.    </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Now What?</b>
                        The experience inspired me to attend more community events and support local talent. Seeing how sports can bring people together, even as a spectator, made me feel more connected to my barangay. If there’s another tournament like this, I’ll be sure to cheer even louder for my friends—and maybe even bring along more supporters to amplify the fun atmosphere!    </p>

                      Although I wasn’t competing, watching the players made me realize how important mental focus and quick reflexes are in sports. I found myself analyzing their techniques, learning from their movements, and feeling inspired to improve my own skills. The enthusiasm of the crowd and the sportsmanship displayed during the matches made it a fun and uplifting experience.</p>

                      <p><b>Now What?</b>
                      This experience has motivated me to try my hand at table tennis again, with a renewed focus on technique and practice. I plan to continue attending more sports events like this, as they not only showcase great talent but also provide valuable lessons in teamwork, dedication, and perseverance. Watching the tournament reminded me of how sports can inspire and bring people together, and I’m excited to apply that energy to my own interests.</p>

                      Watching the tournament highlighted the importance of teamwork and strategy in sports. The players weren’t just focusing on individual performance; they communicated and worked together to win each point. It made me appreciate the coordination and effort it takes to succeed as a team.

                  On October 29, 2024, I participated in the Pasiklaban Badminton tournament organized by Silliman University Senior High School. This event brought together a number of participants to showcase their skills in badminton, an exciting and fast-paced sport. I had the opportunity to compete and experience the thrill of the game, as well as witness some intense matches. The atmosphere was energetic and competitive, with each player giving their best on the court.</p>


                  <br>
                <p><b>So What?</b>
                  This event reinforced the importance of teamwork, focus, and perseverance. Even though badminton is often seen as an individual sport, it requires a lot of strategy, quick thinking, and stamina, which I was reminded of during my matches. Additionally, the friendly competition allowed me to learn from others, observe their techniques, and push myself to improve. The event also gave me a greater appreciation for how sports, like badminton, foster discipline and camaraderie.</p>



                  <br>
                <p><b>Now What?</b>
                  This experience has motivated me to dedicate more time to improving my badminton skills. I plan to practice regularly and participate in more sports events, as I now see how they can help improve both physical fitness and mental clarity. If I participate in future badminton tournaments, I aim to be more strategic in my plays and work on my agility and reflexes to perform better.</p>

                  <br>
                <p><b>Because of this activity, I am...</b>

                  more committed to practicing badminton regularly and enhancing my sportsmanship, both on and off the court. I now recognize the value of consistency and focus in both competitive sports and in everyday life.</p>

              <p><b>What?</b> 
                On October 8, 2024, I attended the Team Sagar Sports Tournament, which featured the Basketball Tournament Quarter Finals of the Kagawad Jason Lagahit Cup Inter-brgy 25 and Under Basketball Tournament. The event was a thrilling display of athleticism and competition, as teams from various barangays faced off in an exciting basketball match. The energy in the crowd was electrifying, with the players showing impressive skill and determination on the court.</p>

                <br>
               <p><b>So What?</b>
                Although I was just a spectator, watching the intensity and passion of the players inspired me to appreciate the hard work and teamwork that goes into sports events. One of the funniest and most unexpected parts of the experience was realizing that some of my barangay friends were playing in the tournament. It was amusing to see each other there, and we shared a good laugh about how we hadn’t expected to see familiar faces competing at such a high level. The event reminded me of the value of community involvement, sportsmanship, and how local events can bring people together, even when you least expect it.</p>

                <br>
              <p><b>Now What?</b>

It made me realize how fun it can be to cheer for friends and see people from my community showcase their talents. I also plan to follow future basketball tournaments and perhaps even join in myself if the opportunity arises.</p>
