                    <p><b>What?</b>
                      On August 19, 2024, from 7:30 AM to 9:00 AM, I participated in the Founders Week Devotion for the College of Computer Studies at Silliman University. This morning worship service marked the beginning of the university's Founders celebration. The event brought together students, faculty, and staff in a spirit of faith and gratitude. As part of the food committee, my role was to help prepare and organize the breakfast that followed the worship service. Our committee ensured that the food was ready and served smoothly, contributing to the warm and welcoming atmosphere. </p>
                      <br> 
                    <p><b>So What?</b>
                      This activity taught me the value of collaboration and attention to detail. Initially, I expected it to be a simple service, but I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of connection and reflection it inspired. The worship was more than just a ceremony, it became a meaningful reminder of Silliman’s legacy and the values we uphold as a community. One of the most impactful moments for me was seeing the joy and gratitude on everyone’s faces as they shared a meal together. It was a humbling experience to know our efforts as the food committee added to their overall experience. The most satisfying part was the sense of accomplishment in creating an environment where everyone felt welcomed and appreciated. On the other hand, the most challenging aspect was ensuring everything was ready on time, but it taught me the importance of planning and teamwork. This experience also reinforced my values of service and compassion, as I realized how small contributions can make a significant difference in fostering a sense of community. </p>
                      <br>
                    <p><b>Now What?</b>
                      This experience has deepened my appreciation for the sense of belonging and faith that events like these bring. It taught me that even small roles, like helping with food preparation, can have a meaningful impact. I plan to continue volunteering for similar activities within the College of Computer Studies and beyond, as I now see how such efforts strengthen bonds within our community. If given the chance to participate again, I would focus more on coordinating with the team ahead of time to ensure even greater efficiency. This activity reminded me of the benefits of working together toward a common goal and the joy of seeing the community come together. </p>
                      <br>
                    <p><b>Because of this activity, I am...</b>
               more aware of the importance of faith, service, and unity in fostering a strong and compassionate community. </p>

                        On August 31, 2024, from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM, I attended the 20th-anniversary celebration of Jesus to Make a Difference (J2MAD) at Silliman Church. The event brought together members and supporters to celebrate two decades of faith and service. I participated as a guest, invited by a friend, and joined in honoring the ministry’s journey and the impact it has made over the years.</p>
                        <br>   
                      <p><b>So What?</b>
                        The celebration reminded me of the power of faith and community. I expected a simple program but was deeply moved by the stories of God’s faithfulness shared throughout the evening. The dedication and unity of the J2MAD members stood out to me, showing how challenges can be overcome with steadfast faith. The most satisfying part was feeling inspired by the joy and gratitude expressed by everyone, which encouraged me to think more deeply about my own faith journey and purpose.</p>
                        <br>   
                      <p><b>Now What?</b>
                        This experience has motivated me to reflect on how I can contribute to making a difference in my community. I learned that even small acts of service, guided by faith, can lead to meaningful change. Moving forward, I hope to participate more actively in similar ministries and apply what I’ve learned about perseverance and giving glory to God. If I could attend again, I would involve myself more by volunteering or supporting their initiatives.</p>

                    <p><b>What?</b>
                    On November 20, 2024, at 6:30 PM, I attended the UCLEM Convocation at Silliman University. The midweek service focused on the Bible verses from 1 Samuel 17:41-47 and Isaiah 43:1-3. These verses were shared to encourage faith and strength in overcoming life's challenges. I participated as a guest and was moved by the message about trusting in God’s power during difficult times.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <p><b>So What?</b>
                    The Bible verses shared during the service reminded me of the importance of faith in overcoming fear. I was particularly impacted by the story of David and Goliath, where David’s trust in God allowed him to face a giant despite his youth and limitations. This story inspired me to confront my own "giants" with the same faith that God will fight for me. Isaiah's words also reassured me that God’s presence is constant, no matter what trials we face. The most satisfying part of this service was the encouragement to rely on God’s strength and overcome fear with faith.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <p><b>Now What?</b>
                    This experience reminded me to trust in God more deeply and rely on His strength in difficult situations. Moving forward, I want to remember that, like David, I can face challenges with confidence, knowing that God is always with me. I plan to continue strengthening my faith and applying these lessons to my daily life. If I could attend again, I would be more reflective on how I can embrace this message more fully in my personal challenges.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <p><b>Because of this activity, I am...</b>
                 more determined to face my challenges with faith, trusting that God is with me every step of the way.</p>

                    On October 23, 2024, at 6:30 PM, I attended the Midweek Worship Service organized by DOST SA SU during Midterms Week at Silliman University. The service was a time for students to reflect and find peace amid the challenges of the academic season. Vin Trixter, the president of DOST SA SU, shared his personal story, and the pastor delivered a message focused on faith and perseverance during hardships.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <p><b>So What?</b>
                    The service reminded me of the importance of turning to God during difficult times. Vin’s story stood out as a powerful reminder that even in life’s darkest moments, God’s guidance and love are always present. The pastor’s message resonated deeply with me, as it emphasized that hardships are not meant to break us but to help us grow. I found it comforting to gather with others in faith, knowing that we all face challenges but are never truly alone. The most fulfilling part of the service was the renewed strength and peace it gave me during a stressful time.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <p><b>Now What?</b>
                    This experience encouraged me to rely more on God during challenging moments and trust His plan for growth and resilience. Moving forward, I want to take time for spiritual reflection, especially during busy and stressful periods, and apply the lessons of faith and perseverance to my daily life. If I could attend a similar service again, I would take the opportunity to invite others who might need encouragement and peace in their own lives.</p>

                  <p><b>So What?</b>
                  The baptism was a beautiful reminder of the power of faith and renewal. Seeing someone publicly declare their commitment to God and be welcomed into the Christian family filled me with joy and hope.

              On October 25, 2024, at 4:00 PM, I participated in the Opening Praise and Worship Night at St. Paul University Dumaguete (SPUD) to celebrate Founders Day. Held at the SPUD ballfield, this event brought together students, alumni, and staff for a night of worship and gratitude. As an alumnus who spent my formative years at SPUD from Grade 2 to Grade 10, this event held special significance for me.</p>
              <br>
              <p><b>So What?</b>
              Being part of this gathering was both an honor and a deeply nostalgic experience. Despite the heavy rain, the spirit of worship and unity among everyone present remained strong. The event reminded me of the many ways SPUD has shaped my faith, values, and friendships over the years. Witnessing the enduring faith and resilience of the SPUD community inspired me, as it reflected the institution's commitment to nurturing its members spiritually and emotionally.</p>
              <br>
              <p><b>Now What?</b>
              This experience reignited my gratitude for the role SPUD played in my life and inspired me to carry forward its lessons of faith, resilience, and community.

            <p><b>What?</b>
            On November 19, 2024, at 6:30 PM, I participated in the Galilean Fellowship at Silliman University Dumaguete as part of Uclem month activities. The fellowship’s theme centered around facing life’s giants, with a focus on the Bible story of David and Goliath. The event encouraged participants to reflect on how faith and courage can help us overcome life’s challenges.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>So What?</b>
            The fellowship made a lasting impact on me, particularly the Bible verse from 1 Samuel 17 about David's courage in confronting Goliath. David's unwavering belief in God’s power inspired me to think about my own "giants", whether they are fears, doubts, or obstacles, and how I can face them with the same confidence in God’s strength. This experience reminded me that no challenge is too great to overcome when we have God on our side.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Now What?</b>
            This fellowship encouraged me to approach life’s difficulties with greater faith and trust in God’s strength. Moving forward, I intend to face my personal struggles with courage and confidence, knowing that God will guide me through any situation. I also plan to encourage others to rely on God’s strength when facing their own challenges.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Because of this activity, I am...</b>
          reminded to approach life's challenges with faith and confidence, trusting that with God’s help, no obstacle is too big to overcome.</p>

        <p><b>What?</b>
        On October 26, I was invited to be part of the choir for the SPUD Alumni Mass, which marked the start of St. Paul University Dumaguete’s (SPUD) Founders Week. As a graduate of SPUD from Grade 10, this invitation felt particularly meaningful. The event gathered alumni, faculty, and students in celebration of the university’s rich history and community. My role as part of the choir allowed me to contribute to the mass, enhancing the spiritual experience for everyone involved.</p>
        
        <p><b>So What?</b>
        Participating in the SPUD Alumni Mass was a deeply nostalgic and humbling experience. It reminded me of the strong bond I share with the SPUD community, which shaped much of my formative years. Singing in the choir alongside other alumni and current students filled me with gratitude for the education and values I received at SPUD. It was moving to see how the institution has continued to foster a sense of unity and faith across generations. This experience helped me reconnect with my roots and feel a part of the ongoing legacy of SPUD.</p>
        
        <p><b>Now What?</b>
        This experience reinforced the importance of community and tradition. Moving forward, I plan to stay connected with my alma mater and support events that celebrate its history and values. Being part of this special occasion reminded me of the impact of spiritual gatherings and how they strengthen bonds among people. I also hope to encourage others to participate in such meaningful events to maintain these connections with their school communities.</p>
        
        <p><b>Because of this activity, I am...</b>
        reminded of the lasting impact SPUD has had on my life and the importance of staying connected with the communities that helped shape who I am today.</p>
