                      On August 22, 2024, from 8:30 AM to 11:30 AM, I attended the Miller Solutions Development Inc. Industry Lecture on "Designing Intuitive User Experience: Key UI/UX Strategies." The lecture was organized by the College of Computer Studies, where we were introduced to the fundamental principles of UI/UX design. As first-year students, it was our first time diving into the significance of user-centered design and how it impacts the user’s experience with products. The session highlighted the importance of making interfaces simple, consistent, and empathetic to user needs, which was a new and valuable perspective for us.</p>
                      
                      <p><b>So What?</b>
                      This lecture opened my eyes to how crucial good design is in creating seamless user experiences. I was surprised at how even small design changes could greatly improve how intuitive a website or app feels. What stood out to me the most was how empathy is a central part of the design process—understanding the users’ needs and challenges can lead to creating more accessible and user-friendly products. The most satisfying part of the event was the hands-on activity where we were challenged to design our own website interface. It made the experience more interactive and helped me understand the real-world application of what we had learned.</p>
                      
                      <p><b>Now What?</b>
                      This experience has inspired me to pursue further knowledge in UI/UX design. I plan to explore more about user-centered design principles and consider how to apply them in my own projects. I am now more interested in the design aspect of technology, not just the development, and I will focus on enhancing my skills in creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. If I could attend a similar lecture again, I would love to dive deeper into the different design tools and software used by professionals.</p>

                    On August 19, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, I participated in the Guidance Counseling Group Dynamics Activity organized by the College of Computer Studies. The event was designed as a "get-to-know-each-other" session, and it included several ice-breaking games to help everyone connect. One of the highlights of the event was the evolution game, where we had to challenge strangers of the same level to a rock-paper-scissors match, moving up the levels as we won. I was also asked to lead a song number, which added a fun element to the day.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>So What?</b>
                    This activity helped me step out of my comfort zone and connect with new people in a fun and relaxed way. I didn’t expect the games to be as engaging and competitive, but the energy and enthusiasm everyone brought to the table made the event enjoyable. The most memorable part for me was leading the song, as it gave me the chance to contribute in a different way and build rapport with others. It was a great reminder of the importance of teamwork and positive energy in creating connections. The activity also allowed me to reflect on how fun and simple interactions can create lasting bonds.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Now What?</b>
                    I plan to take the confidence I gained from this activity into future social and team-building events. I will also aim to contribute in different ways, just as I did by leading the song, and remain open to new experiences that can help strengthen my relationships with others. If I had the chance to participate in a similar activity again, I would try to make sure everyone is included and that the group dynamics are as engaging as possible.</p>

                  On September 18, 2024, at 8:30 AM, I participated in the College of Computer Studies orientation. The event provided us with important information about the college’s rules and guidelines, setting a positive tone for the semester. We were also introduced to the faculty members and learned about the various academic and support services available to students. As the Food Committee Head, I oversaw the provision of cookies at the end of the event, which added a welcoming touch and created a friendly atmosphere.</p>

                  The orientation was a great way to kick-start the semester, as it not only clarified expectations but also made me feel more connected to the college community. I realized how important these sessions are in setting a foundation for success and ensuring that students feel supported. The small gesture of providing cookies helped break the ice and fostered a sense of camaraderie among the attendees. I also appreciated how the teachers were introduced to us, as it gave us a chance to start building relationships early on.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p><b>Now What?</b>
                  After attending the orientation, I plan to make the most of the services and opportunities provided by the college to enhance my academic journey. I also want to continue contributing to similar events in the future, ensuring that they run smoothly and that everyone feels welcomed. If given another opportunity, I would work even closer with the committee to explore other ways to make the event more interactive and engaging for the students.</p>

                <p><b>What?</b> 
                On October 3, 2024, I attended the Robotics and STEM Research Competitions hosted by the Philippine Science High School - Central Visayas Campus in Dumaguete City. The event featured five schools competing in the Robotics Competition and 21 schools showcasing their research in the STEM Research Poster Competition. One of the highlights for me was testing out a game developed by the students, which used motion tracking to create lines—zigzag, circular, or straight—based on the player’s movements. This hands-on experience was both fun and educational, demonstrating how technology and creativity can intersect in innovative ways.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>So What?</b>
                The event was a great reminder of the remarkable talent and creativity in our region. It was inspiring to see the next generation of scientists, engineers, and innovators applying their knowledge and skills in such dynamic ways. The interactive game was a personal highlight, as it showed the real-world applications of technology and gaming in STEM education. Overall, the event reinforced my excitement about pursuing a career in technology, and it encouraged me to think about how innovation can be a tool for learning and problem-solving.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Now What?</b>
                This experience has inspired me to get more involved in STEM projects and competitions in the future. I’m eager to explore more interactive technologies and see how I can incorporate them into my own learning. If I were to participate in a similar event, I would focus on exploring creative ways to combine technology with education, as this seems to be a growing trend. I also plan to keep an eye on future events like this to continue learning and connecting with like-minded individuals.</p>

                more inspired to pursue innovative projects and explore the intersection of technology, creativity, and education in my future endeavors.</p>

The event brought together a group of passionate individuals and organizations committed to making a positive impact in our communities. The program featured inspiring speeches from passionate leaders and student volunteers, emphasizing the importance of service and the potential for collective change.</p>
              <br>
               <p><b>So What?</b>
              The launch served as a powerful reminder of the difference we can make when we work together for the greater good. It reinforced my belief that every small act of service contributes to a larger movement of positive change. The stories shared by volunteers and speakers inspired me to think about how I can contribute to my community in meaningful ways. I realized that being part of such networks not only helps others but also nurtures personal growth and a sense of purpose.</p>
              <br>
              <p><b>Now What?</b>
              This experience has motivated me to actively seek opportunities to get involved in volunteer work, both within the university and in the local community. I am excited about the potential of the Volunteering Network Program and look forward to contributing my time and skills to its cause. Moving forward, I plan to stay engaged with the network and take on more leadership roles in future volunteer initiatives.</p>

          <p><b>What?</b> 
          On August 14, I had the opportunity to be part of the logistics team for the Exec Connect event organized by the Confederates Student Council. This event aimed to give students a chance to join the Executive Committees of the Confederates Student Council. It was a great opportunity to not only sign up but also to shine, make new connections, and grow as a leader in our CCS community. The event featured a variety of exciting activities such as a photo booth, games, a freedom wall, and a tech showcase, all designed to engage and entertain students.</p>

          <p><b>So What?</b>
          Being part of the logistics team was a rewarding experience as it taught me the importance of coordination and planning. My role involved ensuring that all the activities ran smoothly, from setting up the photo booth to assisting with game organization. The event reminded me how important teamwork and collaboration are in executing a successful event. It was exciting to see students actively participate and enjoy the activities, and I felt proud to contribute to such an enjoyable experience.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Now What?</b>
          This experience has motivated me to be more involved in similar events and take on more leadership roles within the student council.

Moving forward, I’m also interested in exploring more about event planning and leadership in the student community.</p>

          <p><b>Because of this activity, I am...</b>
          more eager to step up and contribute to the community, whether through logistics, leadership, or participating in future events. I now understand how vital every role is in making an event successful, and I am excited to take on new challenges that will further my growth as a student leader.</p>
